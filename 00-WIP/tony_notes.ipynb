    "Potential evaporation (PE) or potential evapotranspiration (PET) is defined as the amount of evaporation that would occur if a sufficient water source were available. If the actual evapotranspiration is considered the net result of atmospheric demand for moisture from a surface and the ability of the surface to supply moisture, then PET is a measure of the demand side. Surface and air temperatures, insolation, and wind all affect this. A dryland is a place where annual potential evaporation exceeds annual precipitation. \n",

A requirement for any statistically downscaled product is historical data, or training data, that GCM output is bias corrected to. The two products we produced use different training data. Briefly, one dataset uses the 6-km (1/16th degree) daily product of Livneh et al. (2013) from 1950-2011 that also incorporates the Canadian portion of the Columbia River Basin.

    "The magnitudes of change in temperature and precipitation projected by the datasets are generally similar to each other (Fig. 2). They vary by only +/− 0.3° C for projected increases in mean annual temperature from 1961-1990 to 2071–2100, which is less than a tenth of the overall climate warming projected for the region by the majority of GCMs. For example, MACAv2-METDATA’s projected warming is only about 0.1° C lower than those projected by NEX-DCP30 and ClimateNA for the eastern half of the study area. Projected magnitudes of change in precipitation generally vary less than 6% among the datasets for most of the study area, with isolated areas of higher differences occurring on the leeward slopes of the Cascades and in the dry, southeastern interior portions of the study area. Dissimilarities between all pairs of datasets are comparable in magnitude and spatial extent, although distinct spatial patterns of differences are displayed. For example, the dissimilarity between NEX-DCP30 and ClimateNA are clustered on the arid southeast portion of the study area, and the difference maps involving MACAv2-LIVNEH exhibit greater spatial heterogeneity. These differences in precipitation are minimized significantly when considered in terms of absolute amount of precipitation (Supplementary Fig. S2).

    "Variability in projected future (2071–2100) climate among the datasets is spatially aggregated to watersheds to summarize uncertainty of climate change projections across datasets and to aid their selection, application and interpretation (Fig. 8a). Four different scales of watersheds defined by the US Geological Survey26 are used. For all three climate variables the differences among datasets are minimized when aggregated to large, regional watersheds. Conversely the differences become more acute for small watersheds. For example, at the US Geological Survey hydrologic unit code level 4 (HUC4) and HUC6 levels26, the projected Tmax of all the watersheds differ by less than 0.4 °C. At the HUC10 level, some watersheds have projections that vary by as much as 2.24 °C. More watersheds are divergent on projections of Tmin than the other two climate metrics. At the HUC10 level, projections of Tmax are divergent along the coast and on the western slope of the Cascades, with some watershed having datasets that vary as much as 2.2 °C. Projections of Tmin are the most divergent in high-elevation watersheds across the study area. With projections of precipitation, several watersheds – but not all – in rainshadows of mountains are indicated as having highly divergent data. Detailed rankings of watersheds at the HUC8 level are given in Supplementary Table S2.\n",

    "Variability in projected magnitudes of change to climate aggregated to watersheds may aid studies where the magnitudes of change with respect to a reference period, rather than absolute projections of climate, are more relevant (Fig. 8b). As with projected climate aggregated to watersheds, differences among the datasets are minimized when aggregated to large, regional watersheds. For example, differences in changes to Tmax from 1961–1990 to 2071–2100 among the four downscaled datasets are less than 0.06 °C at HUC4 and HUC6 levels26. As with projected climate, projected change in Tmin is the most divergent, with the vast majority of HUC10 watersheds on the east side of the cascades having relatively more divergent projections of change. For projected magnitudes of change in Tmax, the watersheds with the most divergent datasets are on the west side of the Cascades, especially in the Olympic Peninsula in the northwest corner of the study area. However, as noted previously, the differences in projected magnitudes of change to temperature are small (<0.16 °C). For projected magnitudes of change in precipitation, the drier watersheds in the rainshadows of the Cascades have the most divergent datasets, while the wetter watersheds on the west side of the Cascades exhibit better agreement.\n",
    "General discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "While the differences among the downscaled datasets in their projections of change in climate are generally small for much of the study (Fig. 8b), the projections of future climates vary widely for many HUC8 and HUC10 level watersheds the study area (Fig. 8a). These differences may be critical where biological or physical responses to climate change are non-linear or depend on thresholds. For example, in Western Cascades, as mean annual temperature increases, there is an increased rate of reduction in vegetation carbon due to fire activity27. In that case, selecting a downscaled dataset that is 2 °C warmer than another has larger consequences than may be inferred from the 2 °C difference. In another example, MC1 dynamic global vegetation model triggers fire suppression efforts based on fireline intensity and rate of spread thresholds28. The use of a “warmer” downscaled climate dataset with MC1 instead of a “less warm” dataset would alter whether and when those thresholds are exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variability of datasets aggregated by watersheds (Fig. 8) can serve as a practical guide for selecting downscaled datasets for sub-regional-scale studies. Where the variable(s) of interest (i.e., Tmax, Tmin or precipitation) have a high degree of variability among datasets, there is a greater need to use multiple downscaled datasets to capture the range of future climate projections and the ecological response to those projections. For example, in the Olympic Peninsula in the northwest corner of the study area, there is a relatively high degree of variability among the downscaled datasets, whether their direct climate projections are considered or the magnitude of changes is considered. The average Tmax and Tmin may vary by over 2 °C depending on the choice of downscaled climate dataset, while precipitation may vary by over 20%. Using only one downscaled dataset there may severely bias projections of climate change impacts. Conversely, the watershed maps identify areas where there are good agreements among datasets – this is an important benefit, as dataset selection is typically constrained by many criteria: the need for relevant climate variables, the need to seek the finest resolution data (e.g.,<4 km for plant species distributions29), maximize accuracy24, select high-performing GCMs among the 34 GCMs published by CMIP5, and select appropriate RCP climate change scenarios30. Because not every dataset (Table 3) has all the desired qualities, many study areas may be limited to one downscaled dataset. When only one dataset is suitable, yet there is high uncertainty in a study area due to variability among the downscaled datasets, using a large number of GCMs within the single dataset may help address the range of variability across datasets.\n",
    "Table 3 Key characteristics of the downscaled climate datasets compared in this study.\n",
    "Full size table\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset variability maps (Fig. 8) must be interpreted with some caution because large watersheds, e.g., HUC4 watersheds, include the smaller scale watersheds that have high variability of datasets. Therefore, even regional studies must remain cautious about uncertainty of projections in the smaller watersheds, as well as geographic and topographic features where divergence among datasets is observed (Fig. 6). The coast and high-elevation areas are subject to dissimilar temperature projections, and mountain peaks and their rainshadows may have divergent projections of precipitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pair-wise comparisons of datasets for both the historical and future climate yield nearly identical results (Figs. 1 and 2), and the variability of projected magnitudes of changes in climate is small among the datasets (Fig. 4). These results suggest that variability among downscaled climate datasets is mainly controlled by differences in the observational climate data used as training data for the downscaling methods. Indeed, MACAv2-LIVNEH, which had the most dissimilar climate projections to the other datasets, uses LIVNEH training data, which is the most dissimilar to the other training data (Table 2). Comparisons of MACAv2-METDATA with MACAv2-LIVNEH, which uses the same method but different training data, further illustrate the important role of training data. Projected changes in temperature, averaged latitudinally, vary significantly between MACAv2-METDATA and MACAv2-LIVNEH (Fig. 6b), as do projected changes in precipitation. ClimateNA assimilates only one PRISM normal period (for 1971–2000) into its training data, and calculates normals for other periods using CRU-TS 3.22 dataset31. This is a potential source of differences between the ClimateNA and NEX-DCP30, and MACAv2-METDATA.\n",

We identify two general areas where projections by NEX-DCP30 and MACAv2-METDATA diverge: one, east of the Cascades, projected changes Tmin diverge by more than 0.2 °C (Fig. 6a); and two, at the Cascade crest, projected changes in mean annual precipitation diverge by more than 2% (Fig. 6b). NEX-DCP30 and MACAv2-METDATA use PRISM and METDATA as training data, respectively, and METDATA is based on PRISM. The uncertainty in high-elevation area likely arises from sparse coverage of weather observations, and poorly understood mechanisms of climate change at fine scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downscaled climate datasets we compare use observational climate data as training data, and those observational data have common weather stations. The datasets and the training data are not independent, and pair-wise comparisons are predisposed toward agreement. For the same reason, a truly independent observational dataset does not exist for evaluating downscaled climate datasets. WorldClim (http://www.worldclim.org/) does not serve as an independent observational dataset to compare the downscaled historical climate data because the weather stations from which it draws its data are partly in common with the training data used by the downscaled datasets. A bootstrapping statistical method may effectively address the lack of independent observational dataset for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We compared a limited number of climate variables because they were the only ones common to the four selected downscaled datasets. All except NEX-DCP30 also include variables representing water vapour (e.g., relative or specific humidity) and wind. ClimateNA is available as a software package, which the user can use to downscale future climate projections for a given area, including 27 bioclimate variables. Comparison of additional variables may reveal other important areas of similarity and dissimilarity. We compared climate variables representing monthly averages and totals (temperature and precipitation, respectively). An important disadvantage of monthly data is that they may not sufficiently represent extreme climate events (e.g., drought, heat wave), which can have critical impact on vegetation32, such as forest die-off33. MACAv2-METDATA has been demonstrated to be modestly better than data downscaled using BCSD for simulating climate change impacts on wildfire dynamics11. The coarse temporal resolution of data hinders exploration of ecological processes with fast response to thermal and water stresses. Data downscaled using Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA), where climate projections are constructed from a library of observed fine-scale weather patterns, are likely to better represent the occurrence of extremes than those that downscale using average climate surfaces.\n",
    "Methods\n",
    "Study area\n",
    "\n",
    "We focused on the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, defined as the geographic area from −124.59o to −116.5o longitude, and from 42o to 49o latitude. The study area is 4.4×105 km2 in size and spans two states, Washington and Oregon, in the northwest corner of the conterminous U.S. The climate in the region is Mediterranean, with wet but mild winters, and warm and dry summers. The Cascade Range runs north to south, bisecting the study area. West of the Cascades, moist coniferous forests dominate the landscape. East of the Cascades, the significantly drier climate supports only shrublands and grasslands at lower elevations, while forests occupy higher elevations.\n",
    "Downscaled climate datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "We compared four downscaled climate datasets that are distributed publicly and cover the Pacific Northwest at a relatively high resolution, from 0.5′ to 3.75′: ClimateNA (https://adaptwest.databasin.org/pages/adaptwest-climatena/), NASA NEX-DCP30 (https://cds.nccs.nasa.gov/nex/), MACAv2-METDATA (https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/), and MACAv2-LIVNEH (https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/). Because the four selected datasets are described in detail elsewhere34–36, we provide only a brief overview of each dataset below, and summarize their key characteristic in Table 3. As a set, the four selected downscaled climate datasets represent multiple statistical downscaling methods applied by multiple institutions, using multiple observational data. Bureau of Reclamation distributes a suite of statistically downscaled climate datasets covering the Pacific Northwest37, as does NARCCAP38, an ensemble of dynamically downscaled climate datasets, but we excluded both datasets from our analysis because they have significantly coarser spatial resolution (7.5′).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each statistical downscaling method used to create the four downscaled climate datasets requires the use of an observational climate data as training data. ClimateNA and NEX-DCP30 were created using Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM)39 as training data; MACAv2-METDATA used METDATA36; and MACAv2-LIVNEH used LIVNEH40. To understand the importance training data, we obtained each training dataset, and compared their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparing future climate projections, we selected two representative concentration pathways30, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, to represent the low and high levels of greenhouse gas forcings41. We selected downscaled data from the six Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)42 GCMs that are common to all of the four downscaled datasets: CanESM2, CCSM4, CNRM-CM5, HadGEM2-ES, INMCM4, and IPSL-CM5A-MR. The twelve climate projections we evaluated (two RCPs x six GCMs) project a wide range of climate change in the Pacific Northwest by the end of the century in terms of mean annual temperature and precipitation (Fig. 3). Under RCP8.5, the projected rise in temperature ranges over 3 °C among the six selected GCMs, while the projections of change in precipitation range from 5 to over 20%. Notably, all projections we evaluated project an increase in precipitation, with the exception of INMCM4 under RCP4.5, which projects a small decrease in mean annual precipitation. The six selected GCMs have been evaluated for their ability to simulate the recent historical climate of the Pacific Northwest43, and all except for INMCM4 are among the top twelve best performers out of the 41 GCMs evaluated. INMCM4 was ranked 30 out of 41. For each of the twelve climate projections we selected three climate variables that are common to all four climate datasets: monthly mean of daily maximum temperature (Tmax), monthly mean of daily minimum temperature (Tmin) and monthly precipitation.\n",
    "ClimateNA\n",
    "\n",
    "ClimateNA uses the Delta method31, the simplest of the statistical downscaling methods, to downscale GCM output for North America35,44–46. Multiple training datasets are used to cover North America, with PRISM39 dataset being used for the conterminous U.S. portion of the dataset46. PRISM uses physiographic information to interpolate observations from over 10 000 weather stations into 30″ gridded data39. We evaluated the 1km ClimateNA dataset published by A Climate Adaptation Conservation Planning Database for Western North America (AdaptWest) (https://adaptwest.databasin.org/pages/adaptwest-climatena/). Although the downscaling method used by ClimateNA is relatively simple, ClimateNA prioritizes accessibility and utility by spanning the whole continent and including 27 bioclimatic variables. It is also distributed as a software package, so that end-users may generate their own data. ClimateNA dataset published by AdaptWest comprise eight high performing CMIP5 GCMs selected to represent clusters of similar GCMs47. The published dataset comprises climate normals for two historical periods, 1961-1990 and 1981-2010, and three future time periods under two climate change scenarios30, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5: 2020 s (2011–2040), 2050 s (2041–2070), and 2080 s (2071–2100).\n",
    "NEX-DCP30\n",
    "\n",
    "NEX-DCP30 (https://cds.nccs.nasa.gov/nex/) comprises CMIP5 GCM outputs downscaled to 30″ resolution (approximately 800 m) for the conterminous US using the Bias-Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD) method34. BCSD is more sophisticated than the Delta method43 in that it uses quantile-mapping to bias-correct the lower resolution GCM data to match the distribution of values in the training data before spatially disaggregates the GCM data to match the finer scale spatial patterns of the training data19,22,48. NEX-DCP30 used PRISM39 as the training dataset. Among the four datasets we compared, NEX-DCP30 comprised the greatest number of CMIP5 climate projections, including 34 GCMs under four different RCPs. The variables downscaled are limited to just three fundamental metrics – Tmax, Tmin and precipitation – but the values are given for every month from 1950 to 2099 for each GCM-RCP combination.\n",
    "MACAv2-METDATA\n",
    "\n",
    "MACAv2-METDATA (https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/) was generated using the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) method11, which builds the downscaled climate data time series by matching coarse-scale GCM patterns to a library of fine-scale observed weather patterns, along with a two-stage of bias correction procedure. The MACA method performs better than BCSD in regions of complex terrain11. MACAv2-METDATA uses METDATA36 as training data, which combines NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS)26 with PRISM39. METDATA covers the conterminous US at 2.5’ resolution (approximately 4km) from 1979 to present. The downscaled climate dataset comprises twenty CMIP5 GCMs under two emission scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The data covers the conterminous US at 2.5’ resolution. A suite of 9 climate variables, including maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation, are available at a daily and monthly time step from 1950 to 2099.\n",
    "MACAv2-LIVNEH\n",
    "\n",
    "MACAv2-LIVNEH (https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/) was also generated using the MACA method11, but it was generated using LIVNEH observation dataset as training data. LIVNEH is a long-term hydrologically based dataset of land surface fluxes and states for the conterminous US40. It is gridded at a spatial resolution of 1/16 degrees (3.75′ or approximately 6 km), based on interpolated daily temperature and precipitation observations from ~20 000 NOAA Cooperative Observer stations. MACAv2-LIVNEH dataset includes the same ensemble of GCMs and RCPs as MACAv2-METDATA, and the data have the same spatial extent and temporal resolution and extent as MACAv2-METDATA; however, MACAv2-LIVNEH offers a more limited number of climate variables (Table 3).\n",
    "WorldClim\n",
    "\n",
    "WorldClim (http://www.worldclim.org/) covers global lands surfaces except for Antarctica at 30 arc-second resolution. WorldClim’s 1km resolution climate surfaces were created by interpolating weather station data from Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)49, World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Climatological normals (CLINO)50, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Agroclimatic Database (FAOCLIM)51, plus several regional databases. WorldClim uses 14,835 sites for maximum and minimum temperatures and 47,554 sites for precipitation, some of which may be used also in PRISM, METDATA and LIVNEH. The technique used to create WorldClim’s climate surfaces is unique: it uses a thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm to fit a second-order spline where latitude, longitude, and elevation are independent variables52. WorldClim publishes data only as period averages: 1960–1999 for the recent historical period, and two future periods, 2041–2060 and 2061–2080. Future data are available for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, for 19 GCMs.\n",
    "Comparing the downscaled datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "NEX-DCP30, MACAv2-METDATA, and MACAv2-LIVNEH publish monthly data online, but ClimateNA and WorldClim publish only period averages. The periods published by ClimateNA and WorldClim do not align. Therefore, we chose to focus our comparison on just four datasets – NEX-DCP30, MACAv2-METDATA, MACAv2-LIVNEH, and ClimateNA – by aligning the periods of analysis with those published by ClimateNA. We chose ClimateNA over WorldClim because ClimateNA has a smaller spatial focus (North America vs. global).\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on climate variables that are common to the four downscaled climate datasets we focus on: monthly mean of daily maximum temperature (Tmax), monthly mean of daily minimum temperature (Tmin), and total monthly precipitation downscaled from six GCMs under RCP8.5. MACAv2-LIVNEH downscaled dataset and the LIVNEH training dataset has a spatial resolution of 3.75’ (1/16°), the coarsest among the four downscaled datasets. We interpolated all other datasets to 3.75’ (1/16°) to facilitate comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "We examine the differences among the downscaled climate datasets by calculating the differences between every possible pair of datasets for mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation for two periods, 1961–1990 and 2071–2100 (Figs. 1,2). Mean annual temperature is calculated as the average of annual means of daily maximum and minimum temperatures. Differences are calculated per GCM, and then averaged across the six GCMs common to the four datasets. We examine projected magnitudes of change in climate variables by subtracting the average value from the reference period (1961–1990) from future (2011–2040, 2041–2070, and 2071–2100) period averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To aid in the selection and application of downscaled climate datasets in our study area, we created maps of dataset variability for each of the three climate variables we compared, to identify areas with highly divergent climate datasets. To calculate dataset variability, we first calculated the average of six climate projections for 2071–2100 within a dataset, one climate projection per GCM. Then, for Tmax and Tmin, we calculated standard deviation across the four datasets. The resulting standard deviation grids were aggregated into four levels of watersheds – HUC4, HUC6, HUC8 and HUC10 – defined by the US Geological Survey Watershed Boundary Dataset26. For precipitation, we calculated coefficient of variation across the four datasets, so that the measure of variance is scaled by the magnitude precipitation at a given location. We repeated the above steps for projected magnitudes of change in temperature and precipitation for the four levels of watersheds, to create a set of maps that represent variability of magnitudes of change.\n",
    "\n",
    "To characterize the possible role played by the training datasets in engendering differences among the downscaled datasets, we compared the three training datasets used to create the four downscaled datasets. We calculated seasonal and annual averages for each training dataset and then compared it to the average of the ensemble of the training datasets (Table 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an additional analysis, we compare NEX-DCP30, MACAv2-METDATA and MACAv2-LIVNEH against WorldClim52 (http://www.worldclim.org/) by comparing their characteristics for the 1950–2000 period (Table 1). As previously noted, ClimateNA is published online as period averages with different time periods, and is excluded from this comparison.\n",
